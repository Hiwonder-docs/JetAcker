## 1.6 Development Environment Setup and Configuration

### 1.6.1 Remote Connection Tool Introduction & Installation

Regarding the two methods of remote control for the robot: graphical and command-line control.

NoMachine and VNC are graphical remote control software. After installation, you can directly control the robot on the computer by connecting to the robot's hotspot. For the Jetson Nano, Jetson Orin Nano, and Jetson Orin NX main controllers, NoMachine is used for connection, while the Raspberry Pi 5 main controller uses VNC. With these two software options, users can clearly see the robot's system desktop, making it easier to operate intuitively.

In contrast to NoMachine and VNC, MobaXterm is an SSH connection that focuses more on command-line control. It does not display the full desktop of the robot system, only a command-line window. For users who are familiar with command-line operations, MobaXterm allows quicker control of the robot via commands while reducing computational load and memory usage.

MobaXterm also has a built-in lightweight X11 server that can directly display graphical application interfaces. Regardless of which control board you use, MobaXterm's SSH connection method is applicable.

In short, NoMachine and VNC are suitable for scenarios that require intuitive operation, while MobaXterm is better for quickly executing commands. Choose the software that best fits your remote control needs.

**Before operation,** **users with desktop computers should prepare a wireless network card that supports the 5G frequency band.**

## 1.7 Wireless Handle Control

### 1.7.1 Usage Guideline

(1) Please first confirm if the handle receiver is already plugged in before starting the robot. Ignore this step if it is already plugged in. (the USB handle receiver has already been inserted into the robot during installing )

(2) When installing the batteries, please distinguish the positive and negative poles of the battery.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_1/image215.png" class="common_img" />

(3) After powering on the robot, the app auto-start service will be automatically enabled (app service includes handle control service). If this service is not disabled, no more operations require for it, the robot is allowed to be controlled directly after connecting the wireless handle.

(4) Due to the interactivity of the handle control, when multiple robots are in the same field, it's not recommended to use this function to avoid accidental connection and control errors.

(5) After turning on the wireless handle, if it does not connect the robot within 30 seconds, or no operations with the handle within 5 minutes after connecting to the robot, it will automatically enter sleep mode. If you need to wake up the handle, please press **"START"** button to exit the sleep mode.

### 1.7.2 Device Connection

(1) After the robot is powered on, turn on the switch of the handle. At this point, two LED lights (red and green lights) on the handle will blink simultaneously.

(2) Wait for a few seconds, and the robot and handle will be paired automatically. When pairing is successful, the green LED light will remain on, and the red LED light will turn off.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_1/image216.png" class="common_img" />

## 1.8 Manual Mapping

This section will help you have a quick experience of mapping and navigation functions. No complicated operations are required, users simply click the corresponding icons on the touch screen to perform functions.

The manual mapping requires users to control the movement of the robot using a wireless handle or keyboard. It's recommended you to use wireless handle to control robot if only a single robot appears in the application scenario. If there are multiple robots in the scenario, it's recommended you to a keyboard for control. This is because the wireless handle is interactive, and in environment with multiple robots, it's advisable not to use this function to avoid accidental connections and control errors.

After mapping is complete, the corresponding map is saved. Then, users can activate the autonomous navigation function to view the mapping results. It's important to note that the map opened with the autonomous navigation function will be the last map created. Regardless of which mapping method is used, the newly created map will overwrite the previous one.

### 1.8.1 Preparation for Mapping

Before powering on the robot, it is necessary to ensure that the touch screen is already installed and connected. **Attention: the power cable of the touch screen needs to connect to the C-Touch interface, otherwise, the touch functionality is ineffective.**

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_1/image217.png" class="common_img" />

Next, you need to confirm whether the handle receiver is securely plugged into the USB port of the robot.

:::{Note}
The handle received is already plugged in the USB hub upon receiving the robot.
:::

### 1.8.2 Operation Steps

* **ROS1 Mapping**

## 1.12 ROS Usage Introduction

The core of ROS robot mainly consists of two parts. The first part is the chassis, primarily involving the underlying STM32 controller responsible for robot motion control and sensor data acquisition. The second part is the ROS main control unit (Jetson Nano/Jetson Orin Nano/Jetson Orin NX/RaspberryPi5), running the ROS system and relevant functional routine algorithms.

### 1.12.1 ROS Main Control Hardware Connection

The standard connection method requires a power cable and a USB serial cable to communicate with the ROS main controller via the onboard USB serial port. The STM32 requires a power supply of 9-24V, and the ROS main controllers (Jetson Nano and Raspberry Pi 5) can be directly connected to the STM32's power output port (5V) for power supply through the STM32 power input. The Jetson Orin Nano/Jetson Orin NX requires a 12V power supply.

### 1.12.2 ROS Serial Port Communication Instruction

Serial communication is a common output and transmission method used in microcontroller development and robot manufacturing. This product also utilizes serial communication to communicate with the upper-level machine, Jetson Nano/Jetson Orin Nano/Jetson Orin NX/Raspberry Pi 5, and the lower-level STM32 controller.

In order to facilitate communication between software tools and various products, Hiwonder has standardized a communication protocol based on hexadecimal data transmission called the RRC Communication Protocol. Subsequent Wonder products use this communication protocol for programming and communication between the upper and lower-level machines.

* **Communication Protocol**

The instruction is written in hexadecimal. If you are unfamiliar with the calculation method, you can refer to the following: use a calculator tool for base conversion. For converting negative numbers and floating-point numbers into hexadecimal, please search for tutorials online

Command format:

| Frame header | Function code | Data length | Parameter | Checksum |
|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| 0xAA 0x55 | （uint8_t）Function | （uint8_t）Length | Data | （uint8_t）CRC |

**Frame Header**: Receiving consecutive 0xAA and 0x55 indicates that a data packet has arrived.

**Function Code**: Indicates the purpose of an information frame.

**Data Length**: Specifies the number of parameters.

**Parameter**: Additional control information required apart from the function instruction.

**Checksum**: Verifies whether the data is correct, using the CRC check method (calculates the CRC value of Function, Length, and Data, taking the lower 8 bits).

* **User Sending Data to Control Board**

The control board already has a dedicated UART-to-USB circuit. Simply connect the UART3 port to the PC software using a data cable to enable communication. Here, we use LED control as an example.

**LED light control: Command name PACKET_FUNC_LED, value 1**

| **Frame header** | **Function code** | **Data length** | **Parameter** | **Checksum** |
|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| 0xAA 0x55 | PACKET_FUNC_LED | 7 | Parameter 1:（uint8_t）led_id Parameter 2: (uint16_t) On duration (ms) Parameter 3: (uint16_t) Off duration (ms) Parameter 4: (uint16_t) Number of cycles | CRC |

For example,

① Control LED light to blink 5 times, with each blink lasting 100ms on and 100ms off:

| **Frame header** | **Function code** | **Data length** | **Parameter** | **Checksum** |
|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| 0xAA 0x55 | PACKET_FUNC_LED | 7 | Parameter 1：0x01（1） Parameter 2：0x64 0x00（100） Parameter 3：0x64 0x00（100） Parameter 4：0x05 0x00（5） | CRC |

:::{Note}
This is in little-endian mode. For example, the value 5 (decimal) of uint32_t would be written as 0x00 0x05 in little-endian mode, where the lower byte comes first. Therefore, when sending data, it should be written as 0x05 0x00.
:::

* **Control Board Sending Data to User**

**Bus servo data upload: Command name PACKET_FUNC_BUS_SERVO, value 5**

In this example, we will upload the bus servo position.

| **Frame header** | **Function code** | **Data length** | **Parameter** | **Checksum** |
|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| 0xAA 0x55 | PACKET_FUNC_BUS_SERVO | 5 | Parameter 1: (uint8_t) servo_id Parameter 2: (uint8_t) 0x05 (Sub-command) Parameter 3: (int8_t) Success status (0: Success; -1: Failure) Parameter 4: (int16_t) Servo position | CRC |

When a read command is received, the corresponding servo position parameter is read and uploaded to the PC software.

For example,

Upload the angle of servo 5 as 30°, corresponding to a pulse width of 833.

| **Frame header** | **Function code** | **Data length** | **Parameter** | **Checksum** |
|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| 0xAA 0x55 | PACKET_FUNC_BUS_SERVO | 5 | Parameter 1: 0x05 (5) Parameter 2: 0x05 (Sub-command) Parameter 3: 0x00 (0 - Success) Parameter 4: 0x41 0x03 (833 in little-endian format) | CRC |

## 1.14 STM32 Source Code Instruction

### 1.14.1 Source Code Introduction

The STM32 controller is used as the robot underlying motion controller for running STM32 code. The robot chassis has already been burned with corresponding code for direct usage.

It supports ISP code updates through the USB serial port and can also be updated or debugged through the SWD interface. As the underlying chassis driver board for the robot, it is primarily responsible for the tasks such as motor PID control, encoder and IMU data acquisition, RGB light control, etc. Various control methods are supported, including PS2 wireless control, app control, and remote control via an RC transmitter. Additionally, it communicates through a serial port with the ROS base layer's chassis control node, receiving target vector velocities from the basic layer and sending the real-time speed, IMU data, and battery voltage data calculated by the odometry. To enhance these functionalities, STM32 controller utilizes the FreeRTOS embedded operating system for software design.

### 1.14.2 Control Principle

The principle of various robot control methods is based on varying robot's velocity. Robot's target velocity is obtained by operating inverse kinematics calculation, which is used as input for the motor velocity PID controller. After PID computation, the STM32 timer outputs PWM motor control signals to the motor driver. The motor driver, in turn, controls the motor's rotation. The encoder collects real-time motor speed, providing feedback to the PID controller, thus realizing closed-loop speed control. The flowchart for the robot's STM32 motor control process is illustrated below:

### 1.14.3 Program Framework

The underlying source code is developed based on FreeRTOS. Unlike interrupt control, RTOS executes tasks in a round-robin fashion, with tasks of higher priority being executed first. Interrupts have a higher priority than task priorities. The robot task allocation is shown in the figure below:

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_1/image275.jpeg" class="common_img" />

【The main task of the robot is responsible for robot control, kinematics processing, IMU data acquisition, data transmission matters. Additionally, I also need to handle the trivial tasks such as battery level management, IMU calibration, buzzer alarming, and other low-frequency management issues.】

### 1.14.4 Program Analysis

For more detailed STM32 code instructions, you can go through the source code, which contains very detailed comments.

### 1.14.5 Project Compilation

After writing the program, we need to compile it into machine language so that it can run on the embedded system. Keil5 includes a built-in compiler that can compile the source code into an executable file.

The compiler can generate different target files based on different processor architectures and instruction sets. Additionally, the compiler can perform code optimization to make the generated executable files more efficient and stable. The steps for compiling the project are as follows:

(1) Open options for the generated hex file:

In the Keil5 interface, Click the **"Project"** in the menu bar, and then click the **"Options for File 'app.c'"** button.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_1/image276.png" class="common_img" />

Click the **"Output"** option, check the three red-marked options below, and then click **"OK"**.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_1/image277.png" class="common_img" />

(2) In the Keil5 software interface, click the **"Project"** option in the menu bar, and from the drop-down menu, select **"Build Target"** to compile the project, as shown in the image below:

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_1/image278.png" class="common_img" />

You can also click the icon on the toolbar in the interface to compile, as shown in the image below:

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_1/image279.png" class="common_img" />

If the following content appears in the **"Build Output"** window at the bottom of the software, it indicates that the compilation was successful.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_1/image280.png" class="common_img" />

:::{Note}
If the **"Build Output"** window shows **"Error(s)"** after compiling the project, you need to double-click on the specific line to jump to the corresponding location and make the necessary corrections, then compile again. If **"Warning(s)"** messages appear, you can ignore them.
